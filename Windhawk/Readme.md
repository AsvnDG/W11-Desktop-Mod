Notes
1. "System tray icons" and "Other system tray icons" from Setting > Personalization > Taskbar > System tray icon will be hidden, even if toggled on, but "Other system tray icons" can still be accessed from tray menu (pressing chevron icon)
2. Transparency is not supported due to taskbar will show darker color betwen 2 icon due to overlapped
3. Need to install [TaskSeparator11](https://github.com/DrummerSi/TaskSeparator11) to be able to split pinned icon (max 3 splitter), the steps are as follow:
   - Install TaskSeparator11
   - Go to its folder (Documents\TaskSeparator11\Shortcuts)
   - Copy Splitter.exe
   - Drag the copied exe to taskbar and position it to your liking
   - Some separator might not be updated, restarting explorer.exe is a must
